			<p>This element is responsive. I’ll add some text here so we have something to look at and so that it wraps, but the text itself isn’t important, at the moment.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box-model">
			<p>This is another responsive element, with some more text in it. Again the text doesn’t really matter, I just want a bit of stuff in here. A few lines, is all.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box-model target-content">
			<p>And a third one, to have an element for each rule. I probably should just grab some lorem ipsum, but at this point I’m committed to typing nonsense.</p>
